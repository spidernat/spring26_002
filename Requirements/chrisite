# Space Dual
Story-Driven Rouge like game.

## Requirements
1.) Users will start with 3 total hearts, allowing room for upgrades in the future
2.) Users will also start by doing a base 10 damage to all enemies, unless armor is applied on said enemy
3.) Boss fight necessary on each new floor of the level
4.) Software solution to the game must support and adapt to ALL PC os platforms and console versions with adaptility to mobile
5.) Each player victory of floor must drop an item with the following drop rates:
- Required keepass for next floor (100% drop)
- Common item (grey) (70%)
- Uncommon item (green) (40%)
- Rare item (blue) (20%)
- Epic item (10%)
- Legendary item (5%)
- Mythic item (1%)
Note that these items add over 100%
6.) Drop rate functionality:
The end level boss fight will *always* drop the keepass for the next level.
Then, it cycles through the rest of the drop rates, iteratively testing to see if it hits that percentage.
So in theory, the boss can drop a common, uncommon, rare, etc... at the same time, or could drop nothing.
7.) Each level floor gets exponentially harder, so the user will eventually be eliminated without causing an infinite game loop of levels
8.) Each 10 floors gives the user a perk with a maximum of 10 perks which scale with the type of class build they have
9.) Perks wil be updated and new ones will drop bi-monthly so users can constantly experiment with their favorite builds.
10.) There are 3 base classes to play as and build on: Melee, Magic, and Ranged. Perks will compliment these roles.
  Bosses will utilize the drop rates mentioned earlier to drop modifiers and weapons for users to continue through the tower floors.
